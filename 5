We have array with N*N, so ups and downs could be approximated to N
*For each step, the camel spends 1 unit of water;
water--;
*if at the same time it rises higher, then it spends another 1 unit of water (two times more water);
if(a[i][j]<a[i+L][j+H]);
water -=2;
*At the points of the local minimum, it is filled with 10 units of water;
isMinimum = false
if(a[i][j]<a[i+L][j+H]) then
isMinimum = true;
water += 10;
